# AP Ops | Absolutely Plausible

**Absolutely Plausible — internal operations & invoicing app**

Foundation copied from the `hackFatura` app and re-themed to the Absolutely Plausible
brand (cool watercolour palette, Share Tech Mono).

**Tailoring status — complete (v1.2.0):**

- ✅ Namespace `PCJ` → `AP`; localStorage keys `pcj_*` → `ap_*`
- ✅ Team set to the AP core: Luiz, Bebeco, Samuel
- ✅ Inherited PCJ Spreadsheet ID cleared from `Code.gs`
- ✅ Domain model reworked from karting → AP's real business:
  **Client → Project → entries**

## Domain model

The app is organized around **Clients**, each with one or more **Projects**.
Every work / expense / invoice entry belongs to a Client + Project.

| View | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Log Work** | Billable work — service (Hourly / Custom), description, qty × rate = amount |
| **Log Expense** | Client-billable pass-through costs (kept; optional, under review) |
| **Business Costs** | AP's own overhead — not client-billable |
| **Invoice Builder** | Generate a client invoice — `AP-YYYY-MMDD-001` format |
| **New Client** / **New Project** | Add clients and projects |
| **Client Dashboard** | Per-client totals + per-project breakdown |

Services are deliberately minimal: **Hourly** (rate × qty) and **Custom / quoted**
(flat amount). Entry types: `work`, `expense`, `cost`, `invoice`.

4. Paste the Web App URL into `AP.SHEETS_SCRIPT_URL` in `js/config.js` (currently empty).
